# Luber: :oncoming_automobile: A Car-sharing App :oncoming_taxi:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalableinternetservices/Luber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scalableinternetservices/Luber)
==================================

Sharing economy is efficient, environment-friendly and accessible to all. Uber and Airbnb have swept out the traditional rental business in every aspect. It's much faster and more convenient to ask for a ride by Uber or Lyft, however, sometimes a ride is not sufficient for all travelling demand, in case of family trip, long journey or private event. Therefore, We'd like to work on a Uber-like car-sharing app for CS291A project.

The app is basically a booking system, in which the car owners can post the availability of their car in terms of time, location, model, mileage, photo and price. On the flipping side, the car users can search in the same manner and app will find the best match for both side. At the reserved time and location, the user will pick up the car from the owner and return it, perhaps at another location. All transactions are made online and a rating and review system in app is for users and owners to build up their reputation across board.

This app will have a web version at first, and then derives to a mobile version afterwards.
